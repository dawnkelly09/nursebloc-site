## Nursebloc.io
NurseBloc is a groundbreaking platform that seamlessly connects certified nursing professionals directly with patients. 

**Problem:** Many patients could benefit from nursing care delivered in their home but, the current medical system makes finding and paying for that care an intimidating process that is unfriendly toward patients and nurses. Nursebloc solves this problem by curating a supply of vetted, credentialed nurses and connecting them directly with the patients in their community seeking home nursing care.
